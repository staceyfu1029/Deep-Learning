# Deep-Learning

Homework 1

The homework is to apply at least 3 machine learning algorithm to MNIST dataset and compare with the neutral network (NN) example mentioned on class.

3 ML classifiers I choose:
  1. Support vector machine (SVM): Polynomial kernel, C=0.001, gamma=10. (Kernel and parameters are selected according to https://towardsdatascience.com/support-vector-machine-mnist-digit-classification-with-python-including-my-hand-written-digits-83d6eca7004a
  2. K Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
  3. Decision Tree.
  
Based on the prediciton accuracy, SVM performed as good as NN, while KNN and decision tree were inferior to them.
