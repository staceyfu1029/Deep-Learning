The homework is to implement a few standard models using tensorflow. 
  1) logistic regression (binary outcome and multinomial) 
  2) linear regression 
  3) * optimal separating hyperplanes

and apply them to cat vs dog examples. 

In conclusion, Logistic regression with binary outcome has an accuracy of
